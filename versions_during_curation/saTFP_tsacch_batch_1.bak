time to get solution: 35.29991865158081 s

RESOLVED BY: MAKING HYDROGEN PRODUCTION IRREVERIBLY FORWARD
IN DISCUSSION WITH OUR COLLABORATORS, THEY NOTE HYDROGEN PRODUCTION IN THE SYSTEM, AND SEVERAL WORKS NOTE HYDROGEN PRODUCTION BY C THERM, BUT NONE NOTE HYDROGEN UTILIZATION
FANG. LIU, AND ZHANG, CHARACTERIZATION OF HYDROGEN-PRODUCING GRANULAR SLUDGE BIOTECHNOL. BIOENG. 78:44-52, 2002

NOTE: MAKING HYDFDN IRREVERSIBLE CAUSE LARGE LOSS IN BIOMASS PRODUCTION, FROM 2.2550 TO 0.5604

-------------------------------------------------------------
MDH	model	<-		-0.999
ME1	model	->		0.999
OAADC	model	<-		-0.999
time to get solution: 10.904863834381104 s

REMOVING REVERSE DIRECTION OAADC RESULTS IN NO BIOMASS PRODUCTION!
>NOTE THAT KEGG SPECIFICALLY SAYS IRREVERSIBLE

RESOLUTIONS:
1) ADDED R_PPCK (KEGG PAGE FOR ENZYME SAYS IT IS ALLOWED TO PROCEED IN REVERSE DIRECTION, ESSENTIALLY USESE HC03 AS SUBSTRATE)
2) PREVENTED REVERSE FLUX OF OAADC

NOTE THAT THIS DOES CREATE ANOTHER TIC TO RESOLVE LATER
