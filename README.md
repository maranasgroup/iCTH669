# iCTH669
Repository for the Stoichiometric Genome-Scale Model (GSM) of Clostridium thermocellum

06/17/2022: This repository contains ONLY the two version of the iCTH669 model for the different GAM and NGAM values due to the presence or basence of ADP-glucose synthase (reaction GLGC). The manuscript is in preparation, and the full set of codes and similar will be avialable upon personal request to Wheaton Schroeder at wls5190@psu.edu. Additional codes will be made available upon submission of this manuscript. 

07/25/2022: The repository is updated with all model files as well as scripts, classes, and results files the author believes to be sufficient to recreate the results which will shortly be submitted for publication, as the writing of the draft manuscript is now complete.
